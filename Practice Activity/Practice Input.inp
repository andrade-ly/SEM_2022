MODEL: 
! latent variables

y3 with y4;

OUTPUT:
  standardized ! to get standardized output
  modindices(0) ! to get mod indices (we set it to 0 between parentheses so
                ! we can get all of them -- just relevant for practice today    
  tech1 ! to get the parameter numbers (to answer which is parameter 30)
        ! and to get start values
  tech4; ! to get latent variable correlations (also available in body of
         ! output.
