  TITLE: HK Cancer Study
      Latent Growth Curve Initial Model;

  DATA: file=hkcancer_red2.dat;

  variable:
  NAMES = AGE_GP SURG_TX mood2 mood3 mood4

  USEVARIABLES = mood2 mood3 mood4 socadj2

  MISSING IS *;
  !telling Mplus how our missing data is identified;

  Analysis:
  estimator IS MLR;
  !using MLR estimator - std. errors are robust -
  !bc of missing data;

  Model:

  !these are regression paths linking outcome variables to 
  !intercept and slope factors
  I1 by mood2@1 mood3@1 mood4@1;
  !intercept for mood (I1) is measured by mood2 mood3 mood4;
  !intercept fixed at 1 bc intercept value is constant across
  !time for each P
  S1 by mood2@0 mood3@1 mood4@2.33;
  !slope for mood (I1) is measured by mood2 mood3 mood4;
  !interpret these as slopes; mood2 was at time 1 so no change
  !and therefore @0; other values are a linear transformation
  !of scores (bc no time 0)
  I2 by socadj2@1 socadj3@1 socadj4@1;
  !intercept for social adjustment (I2) is measured by
  !socadj2 socadj3 socadj4
  !same as above for social adjustment outcome
  S2 by socadj2@0 socadj3@1 socadj4@2.33;
  !slope for social adjustment (I2) is measured by
  !socadj2 socadj3 socadj4
  !same as above for social adjustment outcome

  !these are factor covariances
  I1 with S1;
  I2 with S2;
  !intercept and slope factors covary
  !this is a default in mplus (don't actually need to specify)

  [mood2-mood4@0];
  [socadj2-socadj4@0];
  !groups variables as outcomes in model
  !@0 specification relates to intercepts of variables, fixed
  !to zero by default

  [I1 S1]
  !intercept & slope for mood serve as a set of parameters in model
  [I2 S2];
  !ditto for intercept & slope for social adjustment

  !this measurement model is basically a factor analysis with 2 
  !special features: (1) all loadings are fixed; (2) pattern of 
  !factor loadings & mean structure allows us to interpret as 
  !slope & intercept factors
  
  !we'll end up with matrices/vectors which include: (1) constants
  !& known time values invariant across individuals; (2) individual
  !growth parameters (w/in person true change); (3) residuals of
  !outcomes (w/in person noise)

  Output: patterns sampstat modindices;

  plot: type = plot1;
  series is mood2-mood4 (S1) | socadj2-socadj4 (S2);
