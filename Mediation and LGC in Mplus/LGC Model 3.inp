TITLE: HK Cancer Study
    Latent Growth Curve Model 3;

DATA: file=hkcancer_red2.dat;
 
variable:
NAMES = AGE_GP SURG_TX mood2 mood3 mood4
socadj2 socadj3 socadj4 age age2 surg_tx2;

USEVARIABLES = mood2 mood3 mood4 socadj2
socadj3 socadj4;

MISSING IS *;
!telling Mplus how our missing data is identified;

Analysis:
estimator IS MLR;
!using MLR estimator - std. errors are robust - 
!bc of missing data;

Model:

I1 by mood2@1 mood3@1 mood4@1;
!intercept for mood (I1) is measured by mood2 mood3 mood4;
S1 by mood2@0 mood3@1 mood4@2.33;
!slope for mood (I1) is measured by mood2 mood3 mood4;
I2 by socadj2@1 socadj3@1 socadj4@1;
!intercept for social adjustment (I2) is measured by
!socadj2 socadj3 socadj4
S2 by socadj2@0 socadj3@1 socadj4@2.33;
!slope for social adjustment (I2) is measured by
!socadj2 socadj3 socadj4

I1 with S1@0;
I2 with S2;
I2 with S1@0;
S2 with I1@0;
S2 with S1@0;
!intercept and slope factors covary
!this is a default in mplus (don't actually need to specify)
!bc mplus includes this as a default, we need to include
!the non-sig ones from the last model as @0

socadj3 with mood3;

[mood2-mood4@0];
[socadj2-socadj4@0];
!groups variables as outcomes in model
!@0 specification relates to intercepts of variables, fixed
!to zero by default

[I1 S1]
!intercept & slope for mood serve as a set of parameters in model
[I2 S2];
!ditto for intercept & slope for social adjustment

Output: stdyx;
